This code contains a version of Mark Johnson's exhaustive CKY
parser which has been modified to parse with grammars that
include intermingled terminals and nonterminals.  In addition,
it contains a number of minor changes such as improvements to 
the command-line interface.

To use it, change to the src/ directory and type "make".  The
executable you want is named "llncky".
