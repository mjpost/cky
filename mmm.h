/* mmm.h
 *
 * Mark's memory manager
 *
 * Defines CALLOC, MALLOC, REALLOC and FREE, which are just like the
 * standard versions, except that these do varying amounts
 * of sanity checking, depending on the value of NDEBUG.
 *
 * If NDEBUG is defined, they merely check that the memory is actually
 * allocated, and throw an error if it is not.
 *
 * If NDEBUG is not defined, then in addition they:
 *
 *  * check blocks for sanity
 *  * provide a sentinel at either end, and check that it has not been overwritten
 *  * track the number of allocated blocks and allocated bytes
